    "3. Run the model with the selected medium. In this model there are already included a combination of the different mutations that have been proven to work individually with promise to improve xylitol production. This include upregulation of a xylose transporter form the medium to inside of the cell, an upregulation of the xylose reductase, for a higher xylitol conversion, a knock out of the gene XDH in the PPP pathway to prevent xylitol to keep going down the pathway, and an upregulation of the xylitol transporter. In the code below, we can combine these modifications with mediums with different composition, using alternative proportions of the two selected carbon sources: glucose and xylose. The idea behind this experiment is to determine the best conditions for xylitol production while still having cell growth."
