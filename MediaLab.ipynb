    "3. Run the model with the selected medium. In this model there are already included a combination of the different mutations that have been proven to work individually with promise to improve xylitol production. This include upregulation of a xylose transporter form the medium to inside of the cell, an upregulation of the xylose reductase, for a higher xylitol conversion, a knock out of the gene XDH in the PPP pathway to prevent xylitol to keep going down the pathway, and an upregulation of the xylitol transporter. In the code below, we can combine these modifications with mediums with different composition, using alternative proportions of the two selected carbon sources: glucose and xylose. The idea behind this experiment is to determine the best conditions for xylitol production while still having cell growth."

    "We can see how when the model is run with the standard medium medium_glu (no xylose is present) the xylitol transporter, xylose transporter, xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) have flux equal to 0. That means that with out Xylose in the media all the pathway is not active. We can also stablish that when the medium only has xylose, reaction r_2111 associated to cell growth is 0, suggesting that in this medium the cells even though they are able to produce xylitol, they are not able to multiply with the selected mutations. In fact the pure xylose medium with all of the mutations included results in the inhabilty of the cell to survive, while when we combine the mutants with a hybrid medium of xylose/glucose they are able to grow and produce xylitol in at a better rate than the unmodified strain, depending to the media composition. The code above allows the exploration of combinations of mutations and media conditions. The best observed results vary depending the objective you want to achieve. When all of the modifications designed for improving the xylitol production are in place (upregulation of the xylose transporter, upregulation of the xylose reductase (XR), knock out of the xylitol reductase (XR), and up regulation of the xylitol transporter), the best results for growth (r_2111) in combination with maximun xylitol production (r_2104) vary depending on what is prioritariced. The presence of glucose is directly related to an increase in growth, while, with all of this mutations in place, all of the xyolse intake seems to go towards xylitol production and exportation. This corresponds to previous assestments seen in the literature [12], where the possibility is stated of a bioconversion of up to 99%."
