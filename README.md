## Project summary (<300 words)
Xylitol is a commercially viable pentitol that has important applications in the food, odonatological and pharmaceutical industries. The market of this product reaches the 823.6 million USD and is expected to achieve the 1.15 billion USD in the upcoming 3 years. The production of xylitol has been fulfilled by chemical synthesis until now. The fermentation process for production has gained attention. Biotechnological xylitol production is based on xylose metabolism in naturally pentose-fermenting microorganisms, mainly by yeasts that have wild type production, however, not all yeast has the pathways to achieve the production of Xylitol. First, Xylose is reduced into xylitol by a NAD(P)H depending XR (Xylose Reductase) followed by xylitol oxidation to xylulose by XDH (Xylitol Dehydrogenase).

Biotechnological production of xylitol is not yet cost-competitive, and several challenges have to be overcome to reduce the high capital and operational expenses in all the main steps of the production process (pretreatment, detoxification, fermentation and xylitol recovery). Therefore, developing a more robust organism capable to produce higher yields of xylitol would not only have a positive impact in the fermentation step and xylitol recovery, but would also have a positive impact in the detoxification step, as it would be less relevant for the performance of the process.

In this project Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been selected among other cell factories with this pathways present. S. cerevisiae is a robust organism and with many models available, however the production of Xylitol is limited. As mentioned, Xylitol is a product with a high impact in the food industry for this reason the use of a GRAS organism is a huge advantage. The aim is to modify cerevisiae to achieve high titers, by knocking out genes and overexpression of others. The Yeast8 model is the one that is going to be used. 

## Project overview
The main part of this project can be viewed in the Report.ipynb document. Here we have included the backround to the project idea, as well as the results we have obtained, and the discussion of our findings in regards of using *S.cerevisiae* as a and improved cell factory for xylitol production. In the Simulation folder one can find the different files with code used for obtaning results that are discussed and lead to our conclusions, as well as the differnet models that are used in this simulations. They are referenced through the Report.ipynb document when pertinent. The images used in the report are in the img folder. The folder Future work includes code that we would have liked to implement but could not make work, but we would like to implement in the future. Necessary requirements for this repository can be found in the requirements.txt. Finally as a suplement material, an Excel file that contains all the information regarding reactions, metabolites and genes of the yeast8 model is also included as support material.
