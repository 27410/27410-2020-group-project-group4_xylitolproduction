    "Lignocellulosic biomass transformation into a wide range of valuable chemicals and/or fuels is the primary goal of a biorefinery [1–3]. Xylitol is a commercially viable pentitol that has important applications in the food, odonatological, and pharmaceutical industries, besides acting as a platform chemical for the synthesis of other high-value compounds. This include but are not limited to: ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, xylaric acid, and polymers [4]. Xylitol (C5H12O5, M.W., 152.15 gmol$^{–1}$) is a white crystalline powder, with water solubility (at room temperature), sweetness, and a taste similar to sucrose but with lower caloric content, high chemical and microbiological stability, insulin-independent metabolism, which is adequate for diabetic patients, anticariogenic, among other properties [5]. The US Department of Energy (USDOE) included xylitol and sorbitol among the top 12 value-added chemicals produced from lignocellulosic biomass, given the potential market [6].</div>"

    "According to the Research and Market Report [7], the global xylitol market was estimated to be approximately 823.6 million USD, and it is expected to generate more than 1.15 billion USD by 2023. Furthermore, a report by the Grand View Research, Inc. [8] also estimated the global xylitol market to reach 1.37 billion USD by 2025. The xylitol market is also picking up in big markets such as Brazil, where it is expected to achieve substantial growth between 2016 and 2023 owing to consumers’ increasing awareness about its benefits to health, and the increase in per capita incomes [8]. Currently, commercial demand for xylitol has been fulfilled by production with chemical synthesis by companies suchs as DuPont. This process involves the thermochemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomasses such as birch bark to generate a xylose-rich hemicellulosic hydrolysate from which xylose is further purified and then catalytically reduced to xylitol. The purification process however is very expensive due to high amounts of xylose, setting the current market price at around 8-10 USD/kg. With a growing industrial interest and demand, the fermentative xylitol production has gained attention owing to the increased interest in eco-friendly practices as this process allows lower discharge of chemicals into the environment, low carbon prints, less corrosion of reactors, and easy integration with sugarcane/corn-processing mills, as well as a high yield and minimum side products [9, 10].The major bottlenecks for xylitol bioproduction like the absence of feasible and efficient technologies for biomass pretreatment, hemicellulosic hydrolysate fermentation, and complex xylitol recovery, ensure that this bioprocess is still far from the commercial scale. \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Biotechnological xylitol production is based on xylose metabolism in naturally pentose-fermenting microorganisms, mainly by yeasts that have wild type production like <i>Candida sp.</i> or <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus</i>, but also other more traditional modofied cell factories such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. First, xylose is reduced into xylitol by a NAD(P)H depending XR, followed by xylitol oxidation to xylulose catalyzed by NAD+ depending XDH [11]. Xylulose is the integration point with the nonoxidative phase of The Pentoses Phosphate Pathway (PPP) and with the central metabolism of carbon for the regeneration of cofactors, as well as for the formation of intermediates, energy and cellular biomass. Xylitol accumulation is promoted by restricting the oxygen availability as a redox imbalance of NADH/NAD+  under this condition reduces the activity of XDH [11]. Xylitol accumulation causes carbon flow reduction through the central metabolic pathways, particularly the PPP, which is the main NADPH-producing pathway. Consequently, NADPH regeneration becomes an important challenge in xylitol production by yeasts when XR is exclusively dependent on NADPH [11].</div>"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> In this project, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> has been selected among the multiple yeast cell factories with these pathways present. <i>S.cerevisiae</i> is a robust and proven cell factory, with many models and strains available to choose from. Natural production of xylitol in <i>S.cerevisiae</i> is limited, but with the pertinent modifications high titers are achievable. There is literature [12] that show strains of modified <i>S.cerevisiae</i> showing high titers up to 47 g$^{–1}$, which are good but there is still room for them to be improved. There are different potential pathways that can be altered in order to tackle this, such as expressing cytosolic XR, along with b-glucosidase, xylosidase and xylanase displayed on cell surface, XDH gene suppression, or overexpressing GRE3 (endogenous aldose reductase) and SUT1 (xylose transporter). The yeast with these modifications have previously shown no metabolization of the produced xylitol, showing 100% bioconversion efficiency, as well as tolerance for high concentrations of the product. The main limiting factor comes from the fact that yeasts with this kind of mutations require cofactors such as gluconic acid, glycerol or, in the case of <i>S.cerevisiae</i>, cellobiose which presents challenges of its own. These include, but are not limited to, the concentrations or time implementations of the substrate/co substrate to optimize production. [13] On top of that, <i>S.cerevisiae</i> tends to ignore the xylose in the medium when glucose is present.</div>"

    "Even the advances during the recent years in the biotechnological conversion of xylose to xylitol, the high scale production of this product still remains in the hands of the chemical industry through the chemical synthesis from xylose-rich hemicellulose hydrolysates. Biotechnological production of xylitol is not yet cost-competitive, and several challenges have to be overcome to reduce the high capital and operational expenses in all the main steps of the production process (pretreatment, detoxification, fermentation and xylitol recovery) [12]. Therefore, developing a more robust organism capable to produce higher yields of xylitol would not only have a positive impact in the fermentation step and xylitol recovery, but would also have a positive impact in the detoxification step, as it would be less relevant for the performance of the process.</div>"
