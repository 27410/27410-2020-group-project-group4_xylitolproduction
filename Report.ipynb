    "Lignocellulosic biomass transformation into a wide range of valuable chemicals and/or fuels is the primary goal of a biorefinery [1–3]. Xylitol is a commercially viable pentitol that has important applications in the food, odonatological, and pharmaceutical industries, besides acting as a platform chemical for the synthesis of other high-value compounds. This include but are not limited to: ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, xylaric acid, and polymers [4]. Xylitol (C5H12O5, M.W., 152.15 gmol$^{–1}$) is a white crystalline powder, with water solubility (at room temperature), sweetness, and a taste similar to sucrose but with lower caloric content, high chemical and microbiological stability, insulin-independent metabolism, which is adequate for diabetic patients, anticariogenic, among other properties [5]. The US Department of Energy (USDOE) included xylitol and sorbitol among the top 12 value-added chemicals produced from lignocellulosic biomass, given the potential market [6].</div>"

    "According to the Research and Market Report [7], the global xylitol market was estimated to be approximately 823.6 million USD, and it is expected to generate more than 1.15 billion USD by 2023. Furthermore, a report by the Grand View Research, Inc. [8] also estimated the global xylitol market to reach 1.37 billion USD by 2025. The xylitol market is also picking up in big markets such as Brazil, where it is expected to achieve substantial growth between 2016 and 2023 owing to consumers’ increasing awareness about its benefits to health, and the increase in per capita incomes [8]. Currently, commercial demand for xylitol has been fulfilled by production with chemical synthesis by companies suchs as DuPont. This process involves the thermochemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomasses such as birch bark to generate a xylose-rich hemicellulosic hydrolysate from which xylose is further purified and then catalytically reduced to xylitol. The purification process however is very expensive due to high amounts of xylose, setting the current market price at around 8-10 USD/kg. With a growing industrial interest and demand, the fermentative xylitol production has gained attention owing to the increased interest in eco-friendly practices as this process allows lower discharge of chemicals into the environment, low carbon prints, less corrosion of reactors, and easy integration with sugarcane/corn-processing mills, as well as a high yield and minimum side products [9, 10].The major bottlenecks for xylitol bioproduction like the absence of feasible and efficient technologies for biomass pretreatment, hemicellulosic hydrolysate fermentation, and complex xylitol recovery, ensure that this bioprocess is still far from the commercial scale. \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Biotechnological xylitol production is based on xylose metabolism in naturally pentose-fermenting microorganisms, mainly by yeasts that have wild type production like <i>Candida sp.</i> or <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus</i>, but also other more traditional modofied cell factories such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> or <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. First, xylose is reduced into xylitol by a NAD(P)H depending XR, followed by xylitol oxidation to xylulose catalyzed by NAD+ depending XDH [11]. Xylulose is the integration point with the nonoxidative phase of The Pentoses Phosphate Pathway (PPP) and with the central metabolism of carbon for the regeneration of cofactors, as well as for the formation of intermediates, energy and cellular biomass. Xylitol accumulation is promoted by restricting the oxygen availability as a redox imbalance of NADH/NAD+  under this condition reduces the activity of XDH [11]. Xylitol accumulation causes carbon flow reduction through the central metabolic pathways, particularly the PPP, which is the main NADPH-producing pathway. Consequently, NADPH regeneration becomes an important challenge in xylitol production by yeasts when XR is exclusively dependent on NADPH [11].</div>"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> In this project, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> has been selected among the multiple yeast cell factories with these pathways present. <i>S.cerevisiae</i> is a robust and proven cell factory, with many models and strains available to choose from. Natural production of xylitol in <i>S.cerevisiae</i> is limited, but with the pertinent modifications high titers are achievable. There is literature [12] that show strains of modified <i>S.cerevisiae</i> showing high titers up to 47 g$^{–1}$, which are good but there is still room for them to be improved. There are different potential pathways that can be altered in order to tackle this, such as expressing cytosolic XR, along with b-glucosidase, xylosidase and xylanase displayed on cell surface, XDH gene suppression, or overexpressing GRE3 (endogenous aldose reductase) and SUT1 (xylose transporter). The yeast with these modifications have previously shown no metabolization of the produced xylitol, showing 100% bioconversion efficiency, as well as tolerance for high concentrations of the product. The main limiting factor comes from the fact that yeasts with this kind of mutations require cofactors such as gluconic acid, glycerol or, in the case of <i>S.cerevisiae</i>, cellobiose which presents challenges of its own. These include, but are not limited to, the concentrations or time implementations of the substrate/co substrate to optimize production.

Biotechnological production of xylitol is not yet cost-competitive, and several challenges have to be overcome to reduce the high capital and operational expenses in all the main steps of the production process (pretreatment, detoxification, fermentation and xylitol recovery) [12].

    "We can see how when the model is run with the standard medium medium_glu (no xylose is present) the xylitol transporter, xylose transporter, xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) have flux equal to 0. That means that with out Xylose in the media all the pathway is not active. We can also stablish that when the medium only has xylose, reaction r_2111 associated to cell growth is 0, suggesting that in this medium the cells even though they are able to produce xylitol, they are not able to multiply with the selected mutations. In fact the pure xylose medium with all of the mutations included results in the inhabilty of the cell to survive, while when we combine the mutants with a hybrid medium of xylose/glucose they are able to grow and produce xylitol in at a better rate than the unmodified strain, depending to the media composition. The code above allows the exploration of combinations of mutations and media conditions. The best observed results vary depending the objective you want to achieve. When all of the modifications designed for improving the xylitol production are in place (upregulation of the xylose transporter, upregulation of the xylose reductase (XR), knock out of the xylitol dehydrogease (XDH), and up regulation of the xylitol transporter), the best results for growth (r_2111) in combination with maximun xylitol production (r_2104) vary depending on what is prioritariced. The presence of glucose is directly related to an increase in growth, while, with all of this mutations in place, all of the xyolse intake seems to go towards xylitol production and exportation. This corresponds to previous assestments seen in the literature [12], where the possibility is stated of a bioconversion of up to 99%. </div>"

    "However, if we take a look back at Fig. 1, there is a major bottleneck that has not been adressed yet, and that is the presence and availability of the co-factor that mediates the conversion of xylose to xylitol. Without the presence of NADPH, the overexpressed xylose reductase is going to consume the available NADPH present in the cell at a higher rate. The regeneration of this metabolite is linked to the oxidative phase of the PPP, and thus depends of the glucose availability. In this pathway G6PDH converts gluose 6P into 6P-glucanate, and 6PGDH converts it into ribose-5P. In the process, spent NADP gets transformed into NADPH again to be used by XR. The next experiment is going to try to adress how the regulation of this cofators combined with glucose availability can affect the xylitol production. </div>"
